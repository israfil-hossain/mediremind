Positioning: "Try Premium - Cancel Anytime"
Conversion: Offer 7-day free trial
Yearly Subscription (Recommended)
Price: $39.99/year (33% discount vs monthly)
Effective monthly cost: $3.33/month
Target: Long-term users, chronic condition management
Positioning: "Best Value - Save $20/year"
Conversion: Highlight savings, auto-renewal benefit
Psychological pricing: $39.99 feels like $30s, not $40
Lifetime Purchase
Price: $99.99 (one-time payment)
Target: Elderly users who prefer one-time payment, long-term commitment
Positioning: "Pay Once, Use Forever"
Value proposition: Equivalent to 2 years of yearly subscription
